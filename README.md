# IMPROVER Example Data

This repository contains data files used in worked examples within the
[IMPROVER](https://github.com/metoppv/improver) repository.

## Purpose

The data stored here supports tutorial materials, documentation examples,
and test cases that demonstrate IMPROVER's functionality. By maintaining
example data in a separate repository, we keep the main IMPROVER codebase
lean while providing realistic datasets for learning and testing.                       

## Usage

These data files are typically referenced by examples in the IMPROVER
repository. See the [IMPROVER documentation](https://github.com/metoppv/improver)
for specific examples that use this data.
